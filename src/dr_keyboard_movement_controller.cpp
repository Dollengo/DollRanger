thrive and continue innovating. Software piracy not only financially harms the
creators but also discourages the creation of new projects and collaboration
within the community.

By respecting licenses and contributing fairly, you are helping to ensure that
open-source projects continue to be developed and improved. Your integrity and
support are vital for the growth and success of small and independent developers.
Thank you for doing your part.
